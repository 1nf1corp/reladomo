# Reladomo

## What is it? 
Reladomo is an object-relational mapping framework with the following enterprise features:

* Strongly typed compile-time checked query language 
* Bi-temporal chaining 
* Transparent multi-schema support 
* Full support for unit-testable code 

## What can I do with it? 
* Model data as objects with meaningful relationships between them 
* Define classes and relationships using simple XML files 
* Traverse, query, fetch, and update graphs of objects in an idiomatic object-oriented way 
* Manage bi-temporal data using built-in methods 
* Define, create, query, and  update data that has both business date and processing date axes 
* Maintain complete and accurate audit history of changes efficiently 
* Answer as-of questions such as “what did this object look like at the end of last quarter” 
* Build applications as diverse as interactive web-apps to batch-processing 
* Leverage transactions and batch operations to support high-performance throughput 
* Detach objects to allow users to change data off-line 
* Write database vendor-independent code 


## Detailed feature list 
* Strongly typed compile-time checked query language 
* Audit-only, Business time-series only, and Bi-temporal chaining 
* Transparent multi-schema support (partition data across many databases) 
* Object-oriented batch operations 
* Flexible object relationship inflation 
* Detached objects (allow data to be changed independently (a.k.a. delayed edit functionality) of the DB and then pushed (or reset) as and when required) – useful when users are editing data in a GUI form 
* Multi-Threaded matcher Loader (MTLoader) is a high-performance pattern for merging changes from another source (file, feed, other DB, etc.) to your existing DB data. By design it is flexible/customizable and re-runnable 
* Tunable caching by object type – partial, full, full off-heap 
* Available meta-data – enables higher-level programming paradigms 
* Multi-tier operation – obviates the need for direct DB access from client-side apps, enables better connection sharing, with no code changes required 
* Full support for unit-testable code 
* Databases supported include: Sybase (ASE & IQ), DB2, Oracle, Postgres, MS-SQL, H2, Derby, “generic” …
